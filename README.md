# Extended JS++ VSCode syntax & Problem matcher
## !!!Intended to use with [jsppext](https://github.com/al1-ce/jspp-compiler-extension)!!!

# Archived since I do not intend to work on it anymore (at least for now). See jsppext for more detail

Original syntax was taken from [Onux/JS++](https://github.com/onux/jspp) repo.

## Installation:
Copy `jspp.plist` into `.vscode/extensions/onux.jspp-x.x.x/syntaxes/` for improved syntax.

Copy `package.json` into `.vscode/extensions/onux.jspp-x.x.x/` for `$jsppext` problem matcher.
